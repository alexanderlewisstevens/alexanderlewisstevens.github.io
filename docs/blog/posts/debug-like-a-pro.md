# How to Debug Like a Pro

Debugging is a superpower! Here are some tips:

- Use print statements (but donâ€™t forget to remove them).
- Rubber duck debugging: explain your code to a rubber duck.
- Take breaksâ€”sometimes the answer comes when you least expect it.
- Use a real debugger (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.).

Happy debugging! ðŸ¦†
