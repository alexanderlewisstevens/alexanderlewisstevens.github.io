## Recommended VS Code Extensions & Dev Container

Testing Testing 123

The most efficient and reproducible way to work with this project is to use [VS Code Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).  
If you open this workspace in a Dev Container, all required tools and extensions will be installed automatically.

If you are not using Dev Containers, install these extensions:

- **Python** (`ms-python.python`): Required for Python development and running scripts.
- **Docker** (`ms-azuretools.vscode-docker`): Required if you use Docker workflow.
- **Makefile Tools** (`ms-vscode.makefile-tools`): Strongly recommended for running Makefile targets easily.

Optional but helpful:
- **Markdown All in One** (`yzhang.markdown-all-in-one`): For enhanced Markdown editing.
- **Markdown Preview Enhanced** (`shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced`): For advanced Markdown preview, including math.
- **YAML** (`redhat.vscode-yaml`): For editing `mkdocs.yml` and other YAML files.
- **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** (`github.vscode-pull-request-github`): For GitHub integration.
- **Remote - Containers** (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`): If using VS Code Dev Containers.

## Getting Started with Dev Containers

To work with this project in a reproducible environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Open the project in VS Code.**

3. **Reopen in Dev Container:**
   - If prompted, click "Reopen in Container".
   - Or, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), then select:  
     `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

VS Code will automatically build the container, install all dependencies and recommended extensions, and set up your environment.

You can now use the integrated terminal to run Makefile commands or use Docker as described below.

    - Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
    - Why did the function return early? Because it had a timeout!
